# Event-management aka Eventos
Event management service with MERN

This repo contains Eventos client(React) and server(ExpressJS).
Eventos allow users to add event in board and allows logged in users to approved a event to move event to active event from waitlist.

> Note - This is not production ready code and hence there are alot of area to improve but yet I tried to cover as much I can do in 3 days.
> Don't build client because currently I am using proxy request of server it won't work in Production build as this [isssue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/586#issuecomment-244797788) describe.

> If you want to build then use exact url path of server and replace url on all fetch request.
